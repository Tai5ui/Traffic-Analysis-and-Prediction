# Traffic-Analysis-and-Prediction

This project addresses the problem of understanding traffic density patterns to support urban planning and traffic management. By predicting traffic situations based on vehicle counts and times of the day, the project provides insights that can be used to improve public safety, reduce congestion, and optimize infrastructure.

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle:
[Traffic Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibullahaman/traffic-prediction-dataset)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Creating the Virtual Environment

To isolate project dependencies, create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activating the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Installing Required Libraries

Install all necessary libraries by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Prediction Notebook

Open and execute the `Traffic-Analysis-and-Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to train and evaluate the model.
